# Wycorder

This is a project designed to help people self-scan during COVID. It specifically is focused at Wyoming high school athletes.

Currently the project is being designed for mobile. First, it will be local device only. Later, database resources and API server will be publicly available to use if you wish to aggregate data. *NOTE: I am doing this to protect student data. I suspect that these systems should not be publicly available and the app is being designed as such.*

## Privacy

### Mobile
This app is being designed in a way that users have complete control over their data. It will not send data anywhere except where the user specifies. They do not need to specify a location. You can also use the app standalone and not have any connection.

### Web (Planned)
A web version is planned but not yet started.

Since persistence is not possible on the web without database, if you want the web version you will need to make modifications to the code and then compile for web.
